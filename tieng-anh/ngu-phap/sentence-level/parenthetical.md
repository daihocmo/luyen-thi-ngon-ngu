Parenthetical Expressions

![‚úçÔ∏è](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t63/2/16/270d.png)A parenthetical expression is a word or group of words added to a sentence without changing the meaning or grammar of the original sentence.

Some information in a sentence is essential to its meaning, and some details may be less important or "nonessential". The nonessentail portion is called the parenthetical expression:

This example has a complete thought with or without the parenthetical expression:\
The police, hoping to save time, took the expressway.
